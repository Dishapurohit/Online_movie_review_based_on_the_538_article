# Part Two: Exploring Fandango Displayed Scores versus True User Ratings
# Let's first explore the Fandango ratings to see if our analysis agrees with the article's conclusion.

# TASK: Calculate the correlation between the columns:

# Film Title Name (Year)
# Create a new column that is able to strip the year from the title strings and set this new column as YEAR
df['YEAR'] = df['FILM'].apply(lambda title: title.split('(')[-1])

# TASK: How many movies are in the Fandango DataFrame per year?

# As noted in the article, due to HTML and star rating displays, the true user rating may be
# slightly different than the rating shown to a user. Let's visualize this difference in distributions.

# TASK: Create a KDE plot (or multiple kdeplots) that displays the distribution of ratings that

# Part Three: Comparison of Fandango Ratings to Other Sites
# Let's now compare the scores from Fandango to other movies sites and see how they compare.

# Rotten Tomatoes
# Let's first take a look at Rotten Tomatoes. RT has two sets of reviews, their critics reviews
# (ratings published by official critics) and user reviews.

# TASK: Create a scatterplot exploring the relationship between RT Critic reviews and RT User reviews.
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4), dpi=150)

# Let's quantify this difference by comparing the critics ratings and the RT User ratings.
# We will calculate this with RottenTomatoes-RottenTomatoes_User. Note: Rotten_Diff here is Critics -
# User Score. So values closer to 0 means agreement between Critics and Users.

# Larger positive values means critics rated much higher than users.
# Larger negative values means users rated much higher than critics.

# TASK: Create a new column based off the difference between critics ratings and users ratings for
# Rotten Tomatoes. Calculate this with RottenTomatoes-RottenTomatoes_User

# Let's now compare the overall mean difference. Since we're dealing with differences that could be

# This would report back on average to absolute difference between the critics rating versus the user rating.

# TASK: Calculate the Mean Absolute Difference between RT_scores and RT_User_scores as described above.
print(df1['Rotten_Diff'].apply(abs).mean())

# TASK: Plot the distribution of the differences between RT Critics Score and RT User Score.
# There should be negative values in this distribution plot. Feel free to use KDE or Histograms to
# display this distribution.
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4), dpi=150)

# Let's find out which movies are causing the largest differences. First, show the top 5 movies with the

# Rating - Users Rating, then large negative values imply the users rated the movie much higher on average
# than the critics did.

# TASK: What are the top 5 movies users rated higher than critics on average:
print("Users Love but Critics Hate")
print(df1.nsmallest(5, 'Rotten_Diff')[['FILM', 'Rotten_Diff']])

# TASK: Now show the top 5 movies critics scores higher than users on average.
print("Critics love, but Users Hate")
print(df1.nlargest(5, 'Rotten_Diff')[['FILM', 'Rotten_Diff']])


# MetaCritic
# Now let's take a quick look at the ratings from MetaCritic. Metacritic also shows an average user rating
# versus their official displayed rating.

# TASK: Display a scatterplot of the Metacritic Rating versus the Metacritic User rating.
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4), dpi=150)

# IMBD
# Finally let's explore IMDB. Notice that both Metacritic and IMDB report back vote counts.
# Let's analyze the most popular movies.

# TASK: Create a scatterplot for the relationship between vote counts on MetaCritic versus vote counts on IMDB.
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4), dpi=150)

# 500 Metacritic ratings. What is this movie?

# TASK: What movie has the highest Metacritic User Vote count?

# Fandago Scores vs. All Sites
# Finally let's begin to explore whether or not Fandango artificially displays higher ratings than
# warranted to boost ticket sales.

# TASK: Combine the Fandango Table with the All Sites table. Not every movie in the Fandango table is in
# the All Sites table, since some Fandango movies have very little or no reviews.
# We only want to compare movies that are in both DataFrames, so do an inner merge to merge together both
# DataFrames based on the FILM columns.
df = pd.merge(df, df1, on='FILM', how='inner')

# Normalize columns to Fandango STARS and RATINGS 0-5
# Notice that RT,Metacritic, and IMDB don't use a score between 0-5 stars like Fandango does.
# In order to do a fair comparison, we need to normalize these values so they all fall between 0-5 stars
# and the relationship between reviews stays the same.

# TASK: Create new normalized columns for all ratings so they match up within the 0-5 star range shown
# on Fandango. There are many ways to do this.

# Easier Hint:
# Keep in mind, a simple way to convert ratings:
# 100/20 = 5
# 10/2 = 5

# Don't run this cell multiple times, otherwise you keep dividing!
df['RT_Norm'] = np.round(df['RottenTomatoes']/20, 1)
df['RTU_Norm'] = np.round(df['RottenTomatoes_User']/20, 1)

# Don't run this cell multiple times, otherwise you keep dividing!
df['Meta_Norm'] = np.round(df['Metacritic']/20, 1)
df['Meta_U_Norm'] = np.round(df['Metacritic_User']/2, 1)

# Don't run this cell multiple times, otherwise you keep dividing!
df['IMDB_Norm'] = np.round(df['IMDB']/2, 1)
print(df.head())

# TASK: Now create a norm_scores DataFrame that only contains the normalizes ratings.
# Include both STARS and RATING from the original Fandango table.
norm_scores = df[['STARS', 'RATING', 'RT_Norm', 'RTU_Norm', 'Meta_Norm', 'Meta_U_Norm', 'IMDB_Norm']]
print(norm_scores.head())

# Comparing Distribution of Scores Across Sites
# Now the moment of truth! Does Fandango display abnormally high ratings? We already know it pushes displayed
# RATING higher than STARS, but are the ratings themselves higher than average?

# TASK: Create a plot comparing the distributions of normalized ratings across all sites.
# There are many ways to do this, but explore the Seaborn KDEplot docs for some simple ways to quickly
# show this. Don't worry if your plot format does not look exactly the same as ours, as long as the
# differences in distribution are clear.
